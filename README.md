### Description
On this project, data provided by Motivate, a bike share service provider was used to uncover usage patterns across three cities: Chicago, New York and Washington. The data snapshot included the first half of 2017.

Based on user specified filter criteria for city, month or range and specific days of the week, insights were derived by the program.
- Most popular times of travel including the month, day of the week and starting hour
- Most popular stations including the start, end and trip stations
- Trip duration summary statistics
- Where available, a summary of user categorization based on type, gender and date of birth
